## 💥 Kaboom JS Bloob Boy – Bugs and Beautiful Chaos

Welcome to my glorious Kaboom.js project, also known as:  
> *“Let’s see how far this goes before everything literally explodes.”*

This is a simple game built with **pure JavaScript** + **Kaboom.js**, created with one goal:  
**learn by breaking things**.  
Professional? 🤡 Nope. Fun? 😎 Absolutely.

## 🚀 Why Does This Exist?
- I want to learn Kaboom.js the *wrong but fun* way (by messing with stuff)  
- I need to practice modules and “organization” (quotes necessary)  
- I want a simple platformer full of charming bugs  
- Because **programming is more fun when you suffer on purpose**

## 🎮 What Is This Game?
A humble, indie, minimalist, probably unbalanced platformer, powered by:
- Kaboom.js  
- Weird physics  
- Questionable collision logic  
- Ideas created on the spot while coding  

If something works on the first try, don’t trust it. It’s probably a bug.

## 📦 Technologies (aka Who’s to Blame)
- **Pure JavaScript**  
- **Kaboom.js**  
- **Caffeine, sadness or artificial fruit juice**  
- **Hope mixed with despair**

No extra frameworks. No huge engines. Just Kaboom + controlled chaos.

## 🛠️ How It Was (Badly) Made
The project uses modules because apparently that makes things “clean”:
- `player.js` → the character who sometimes ignores physics  
- `enemy.js` → enemies with snail-level intelligence  
- `level.js` → levels that may or may not instantly kill you  

Expect:
- magical `if` statements  
- collisions that work only when they feel like it  
- variable names created on the spot  
- comments that don’t even help future me

## 📚 Project Status
Currently in **“test and pray” mode**.  
Things are **working**, **breaking**, **exploding**, **magically fixing themselves**, then **breaking again**.  
It’s beautiful. It’s poetic. It’s Kaboom.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer (for sensitive developers)
This is **NOT** optimized.  
This does **NOT** follow clean code principles.  
If you care about proper architecture, proceed at your own risk.

Code quality: ❌

No license.  
Take whatever you want.  
Just don’t blame me when the game launches itself off the screen 😄💥
